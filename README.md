# mapviewer : Esri-Leaflet sample in ClojureScript

This is just a sample application of an [Esri-Leaflet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet) sample rewritten in [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript). This is really just practice for me.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
